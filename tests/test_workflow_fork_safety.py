"""Static fork-PR safety audit of every GitHub Actions workflow.

Pull-request checks must run fork-controlled code without privileged
credentials. This is source/configuration evidence only: it does not prove a
fork-origin run was observed. It uses only the standard library because CI runs
these tests without installing dependencies, so the audit reads the repository's
plain block-style workflow layout instead of parsing arbitrary YAML. Because a
hand-rolled reader can misread what it does not understand, it FAILS CLOSED:
quoted keys are normalized in one place, and any construct outside the supported
subset (flow mappings, flow sequences outside a few simple keys, anchors, aliases,
merge keys, tags, multi-document files, multi-line quoted scalars, unknown `on:`
events, unknown top-level or job-level keys) is reported as "unsupported workflow
syntax" rather than skipped.

Case rules follow GitHub: expression contexts and property names (`secrets`,
`github.head_ref`, the workflow_run guards, `GITHUB_TOKEN`), runner labels,
workflow names in `workflow_run.workflows` and boolean values are matched
case-insensitively; YAML keys, event names, permission scope names and branch
names are case-sensitive, and a miscased one is never silently skipped (it
fails the unknown-key, unknown-event or permission checks instead).

Universal rules (every workflow): no pull_request_target or other
pull-request-adjacent privileged trigger, actions pinned to full commit SHAs,
checkout without persisted credentials, and no checkout of a pull-request head.
Strict rules (workflows reachable from a pull request, directly or through a
workflow_run chain): read-only permissions, no secret other than GITHUB_TOKEN,
no deployment environment, only allowlisted GitHub-hosted runners, and guarded
workflow_run jobs.

Deployment rule: a workflow that needs secrets, an environment or write
permissions must be triggered only by push to main (or another trigger no pull
request can start) and must NOT be a workflow_run follower of a PR-triggered
workflow or a callee of one. A workflow_run follower of a PR workflow stays
PR-reachable, and therefore strict, even when its job guards look correct: the
guards are textual, and the followed run may carry fork code. Split deployment
into its own push-triggered workflow instead of relaxing this audit.
